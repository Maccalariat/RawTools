# RawTools
another attempt at dcraw
This project is *totally* work in progress.
I am learning git/github/cmake, so the contents of this can change in an unpredictable manner.

In any case, this is an attempt to rewrite dcraw (as a learning process).
The approach is to simplify the approach and use the in-file metadata which should remove a lot of code from the 
dcraw identify() routine. ... that's the theory.

The focus in on Sony ARW2 files right now.
